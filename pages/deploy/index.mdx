# Deploy

Wasmer Deploy allows running Wasmer containers in the Wasmer Edge Nodes. It's also self-hostable (soon!).

<Callout type="warning">
  Wasmer Deploy is still in heavy development. Do not use yet for production
  usages.
</Callout>

Current status:

- **Dev**: In heavy development, features are being added and APIs have breaking changes
- ~~**Alpha**~~: Missing features and bugs to fix, not ready for production usage
- ~~**Beta**~~: Stable APIs, last bugs are being fixed and last features are being added
- ~~**General Availability**~~: Cloud version available for production usage
- ~~**Open Source**~~: Open Source version available for creating your own servers and using it on-premise

# Features

* Based on the [Wasmer Runtime](/runtime)
* Supports the following runners:
  * WASIX: *any* programming language and framework
  * WCGI: CGIs on top of WebAssembly
* Deploy APIs, SSR(ed) websites, Webhooks endpoints, Cron jobs...
* CLI to manage websites and develop locally
* Deploy at the Edge using the Cloud version, or self-host it (soon!)
* 100% open-source (soon!)

# How it works

Wasmer Deploy uses [Wasmer Runtime](/runtime), which are sandboxed environments used to run applications anywher.
That means each application memory is isolated from each others, and you can run a lot of them at the same time with very few resources.

Starting an Wasmer Container is a lot faster than starting a Docker container, which allows for almost free cold starts.


TODO:
* Investigate Vercel for dev/staging/prod workflows
* Investigate Cloudflare for wrangler config
* Investigate Fly.io for Deployment config (`fly.toml`)
* Port mapping
