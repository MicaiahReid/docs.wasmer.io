# Starter guide for deploying a Python Worker

In this guide, you'll learn the process of deploying a python worker on Wasmer Edge.

## Deploying a Python Worker

<Steps>

<Install />

<CliVersionCallout />

<Login />

### Step 3.1: Initialize the Python Worker Starter template

```shell copy
$ wasmer app create
App type:
  Static website
  HTTP server
  Browser shell
  JS Worker (experimental)
> Python Worker
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This is an interactive command. You can also use the `--type` flag to specify
  the app type.
</Callout>

Further you will be prompted to enter your package name and app name. You can choose any name you like.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="🚧">
  The app names should be globally unique across all apps on the registry.
</Callout>

You directory composition should look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="main.py" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
  <FileTree.File name="app.yaml" />
</FileTree>

### Step 3.2: Testing your Python Worker locally

Run the commands below to initialize files for Wasmer Edge:

```shell copy
$ wasmer run . --net --env PORT=4333
Starting server on http://127.0.0.1:4333
```

The above command will start a web server on `http://127.0.0.1:4333`.

Let's try to cURL the server:

```shell copy
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:4333
"message": "wasmer/py-worker-test is running on Python!"
```

### Step 3.3: Deploying your Python Worker

Deploying is the easiest part. Just run the following command:

```shell copy
$ wasmer deploy
Deploying app wasmer/py-worker-test...

 ✅ App wasmer/py-worker-test was successfully deployed!

> App URL: https://wasmer-py-worker-test-worker.wasmer.app
> Versioned URL: https://rkkh7ikcgv1r.id.wasmer.app
> Admin dashboard: https://wasmer.io/apps/wasmer/wasmer-py-worker-test-worker
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You must be in the directory holding the `wasmer.toml` and `app.yaml` config
  files.
</Callout>

<Callout type="transparent" emoji="💁">
  You can view the above info again using `wasmer app info`.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your python worker on Wasmer Edge.
