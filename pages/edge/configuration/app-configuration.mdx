# Wasmer Edge Configuration

Wasmer Edge's configuration is stored in a `app.yaml` file in the root of your project.

## Example

For a basic static site this file contains the following information:

```yaml copy
kind: wasmer.io/App.v0
name: my-sample-site
description: A sample site for demonstration (optional)
package: wasmer/my-sample-site

# Specify environment variables
env:
  MY_VAR: "my-value123"
```

## Fields

### `kind`

The `kind` field is used to identify the type of configuration file. It is required and is a constant set to `wasmer.io/App.v0`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This constant field might be used in the future to support multiple
  configuration formats.
</Callout>

### `name`

The `name` field is used to identify the name of the application. It is **required** and must be unique.

- Required: `true`
- Required format: `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$`

### `description`

The `description` field is used to provide a description of the application. It is **optional** and can be any string.

- Required: `false`

### `package`

The `package` field is used to specify the name of the package to deploy.
It is **required** and must specify a package published to the Wasmer registry.

- Required: `true`

### `env`

Specify environment variables for the app.
Must be a key-value map.

Example:
```yaml
env:
  MY_VAR: "my-value123"
```

- Required: `false`

### `debug`

The `debug` field is used to enable debug mode for the application. This in turn will show detailed error messages if a request fails, instead of a generic error. It is **optional** and can be any boolean.

- Required: `false`
- Default: `false`

### `health_checks`

The `health_checks` field is used to check if an application is working correctly. If the healthchecks fail, edge will restart the application. It is **optional** and its an array of healtcheck objects

- Required: `false`

Currently only supported healthcheck type is `http`. It executes an http request against the application. All the supported 

##### Example healthcheck
```
health_checks:
  - http:
      method: get
      path: /
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      unhealthy_threshold: 2
      healthy_threshold: 1
      expected_status_codes:
        - 200
      # below are optional
      expected_body_includes: Hello World
      expected_body_regex: ".*Wasmer.*"
```
Fields for http healthcheck:
- #### `method`: Required

- #### `path`: Required
  Path to send request to. 
- #### `interval`: Required
  Duration between each request
- #### `timeout`: Required
  Timeout duration for requests
- #### `unhealthy_threshold`: Required
  After `unhealthy_threshold` amount of failure of the http requests, app is considered unhealthy and will be restarted
- #### `healthy_threshold`: Required
  After `healthy_threshold` amount of failure of the http requests, app is considered healthy and will be restarted
- #### `expected_status_codes`: Required
  If the application returns these status codes, then the request will be count as successful
- #### `expected_body_includes`:
  If this is specified, response body should include the string defined in this field to be count as successful
- #### `expected_body_regex`:
  If this is specified, response body should be able to match the regular expression defined in this field to be count as successful
