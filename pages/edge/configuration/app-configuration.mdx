# Wasmer Edge Configuration

Wasmer Edge's configuration is stored in a `app.yaml` file in the root of your project.

## Example

For a basic static site this file contains the following information:

```yaml copy
kind: wasmer.io/App.v0
name: my-sample-site
description: A sample site for demonstration (optional)
package: wasmer/my-sample-site
```

## Fields

### `kind`

The `kind` field is used to identify the type of configuration file. It is required and is a constant set to `wasmer.io/App.v0`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This constant field might be used in the future to support multiple
  configuration formats.
</Callout>

### `name`

The `name` field is used to identify the name of the application. It is **required** and must be unique.

- Required: `true`
- Required format: `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$`

### `description`

The `description` field is used to provide a description of the application. It is **optional** and can be any string.

### `package`

The `package` field is used to provide the primary workload to execute. It is **required** and must be a valid WebAssembly package identifier.
