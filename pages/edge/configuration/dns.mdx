# DNS

You can point any custom subdomains or domains to your application by modifying the DNS records.

There are two ways:

## Root domain

You will need to add an `A` record with the name `@` and the value being the IP of one of Wasmer Edge deployments: `5.161.213.176`.

Also, you'll need to add a TXT record with the name `@` having the value `cname:<YOURAPP>.wasmer.app.` 

## Subdomains

Pointing a subdomain is fairly easy, you just will need to add a cname record to your domain:

Kind: `CNAME`
Name: `subdomain.domain.com`
Value: `<YOURAPP>.wasmer.app.`
