# Using custom domains with Wasmer Edge

You can point any custom subdomains or domains to your application by **updating the DNS records** of your domain.

There are two ways of doing so:

## Root domain (eg: mydomain.com)

You will need to add an `A` record with the name `@` and the value being the IP of one of Wasmer Edge deployments: `5.161.213.176`.

Also, you'll need to add a TXT record with the name `@` having the value `cname:<YOURAPP>.wasmer.app.` 

## Subdomains (eg: subdomain.mydomain.com)

Pointing a subdomain is fairly easy, you just will need to add a cname record to your domain:

Kind: `CNAME`
Name: `subdomain.domain.com`
Value: `<YOURAPP>.wasmer.app.`
