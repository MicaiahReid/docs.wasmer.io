# Wasmer Edge

<Callout type="warning">
  Wasmer Edge is still under heavy development and is not ready yet for
  production usage.
</Callout>

Wasmer Edge is a next-generation cloud platform, built from the ground up to
enable the Wasmer vision:

> Run, Publish & Deploy any code - anywhere.



Edge harnesses WebAssembly, the Wasmer runtime and WASI(X) to enable
secure, scalable and cost-effective global deployments of your applications with
minimal operational complexity.

---


The guiding principles of Wasmer Edge are:

- **Simplicity**: Designed to be a joy to use, with a
  developer-centric workflow and a focus on productivity.
  For standard use cases, the platform should be trivial to understand,
  hiding all underlying complexity from the user.
- **Power**: Ease of use should not imply a limited feature set.
  Edge aims to enable complex deployment scenarios that can currently only be
  fulfilled by complicated systems like Kubernetes or the large cloud providers.
- **Security**: WebAssembly enables secure, sandboxed execution of untrusted code,
  without the burden of additional emulation layers like containers or virtual machines.
  Users can define tightly scoped, fine-grained permissions to limit the attack surface
  of their applications.
- **Scalability**: Applications scale seamlessly, all the way from zero
  up to serving millions of requests per second, or running thousands of concurrent
  instances, empowered by WebAssembly's small footprint and fast startup time.
  The core platform itself is also designed to scale seamlessly, from a single
  server to large, globally distributed clusters.
- **Resilience**: Outages are a common occurrence today, even for the largest cloud
  providers.
  Edge is designed around a **shared nothing** architecture. Each server
  can continue to operate independently, without relying on any shared services,
  which also means your workloads are shielded from larger outages.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: WebAssembly enables much more resource-effective startup,
  scaling and operation than traditional container and virtualization technologies.
  We aim to pass down these benefits to our users, and provide extremely competitive
  pricing.

### Status of Wasmer Edge

- [x] **Alpha**: Missing features and bugs to fix, not ready for production usage, breaking changes should be rare but can occur
- [ ] **Beta**: Stable APIs, last bugs are being fixed and last features are being added
- [ ] **General Availability**: Cloud version available for production usage
- [ ] **Open Source**: Open Source version available for creating your own servers and using it on-premise

## Features

The current early access version comes with a limited set of features.

Many additional features are planned, some of them coming really soon!

### Available Features

- Run stateless, auto-scaled WebAssembly HTTP apps:
  The only way to serve your workloads at the moment is through HTTP.
  You can use [WASIX - TODO: insert WASIX link](./) or
  [WCGI - TODO: insert WCGI link](./) to build servers in WebAssembly.
- Automatic scaling:
  Workloads will be served by the Wasmer Edge network, on the servers closest
  to the user, and will scale automatically to meet the demand.
- Auto-domains and aliases:
  Each deployed app will be reachable through a unique URL, `[NAME].wasmer.app`.
  You can also configure additional aliases.
- Versioned deployments and rollback:
  App deployment versions are tracked.
  You can always access previous versions though a special URL, and rollback to
  previous versions with a single CLI command or click.
  You can also publish preview-versions and test them before switching them to active.
- Custom domains with automatic SSL:
  You can configure custom domains for your applications.
  SSL certificates will automatically be provisioned and renewed for you.

### Features in Development

#### Persistent workloads

Apps are stateless and auto-scaled by default, which is great for scalability
and cost-effectiveness, but sometimes you need to run a persistent workload
that keep running, even with no requests coming in.

Persistent workloads will enable you to provision a fixed number of instances
that are kept alive by the edge runtime.

#### Persistent volumes

Stateless apps are great for scalability, but eventually the state needs to
live somewhere.
You will be able to create persistent volumes, and mount these volumes into
your workloads.

#### Private network:

Create secure, private networks to connect your workloads globally.
Powered by [DNET - TODO: insert dnet architecture link](./);

#### Scheduled tasks / cronjobs:

Running tasks at a certain interval is a common requirement.
You will be able to configure scheduled invocation of your apps at a given interval.
The web UI and CLI will allow inspecting logs and success status of the task runs.
