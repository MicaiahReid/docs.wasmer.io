# Get Started with Wasmer Edge

The process to get started with Wasmer Edge is extremely short and intuitive: just install 
the CLI and run a single command. In this page we show this two steps in detail. 

<Steps>
 
<Install />

### Run `wasmer deploy`
This command will make sure that everything is inplace for you to deploy your
app: it will guide you through the login, the creation of the app and its deployment.

```shell
$ wasmer deploy                                             
? Do you want to login now? (y/n) › y 
....
```

Once you are logged in, the same command will detect that no app is already
available in the current directory and prompt you to create a new one, first choosing the owner 
of the app..

```shell
$ wasmer deploy                                             
...
Login for Wasmer user <you> saved
It seems you are trying to create a new app!
? Who should own this app? ›
❯ <you> 
```

then the name of the app..

```shell
$ wasmer deploy                                             
...
✔ Who should own this app?  · <you>
? What should be the name of the app? › <your app name> 
````

..and finally the _kind_ of app you want to deploy:
```shell
$ wasmer deploy                                             
...
✔ Who should own this app?  · <you>
✔ What should be the name of the app?  · <your app name> 
? What would you like to deploy? ›
❯ Start with a template
  Choose an existing package
```

To get a grasp of this process, we suggest you to choose to create the app from 
[an existing package](https://wasmer.io/wasmer/hello): 

```shell
$ wasmer deploy                                             
...
✔ Who should own this app? · <you> 
✔ What should be the name of the app? · <your-app-name> 
✔ What would you like to deploy? · Choose an existing package
✔ What is the name of the package? · wasmer/hello
```

Once this last step to create an app is finished, the same command will deploy
your first app, without having you execute any other!

```shell
$ wasmer deploy                                             
...
✔ Who should own this app? · <your-app> 
✔ What should be the name of the app? · <your-app-name> 
✔ What would you like to deploy? · Choose an existing package
✔ What is the name of the package? · wasmer/hello
✔ Do you want to deploy the app now? · yes

Deploying app <your-app-name> (<you>) to Wasmer Edge...

App <your-app-name> (<you>) was successfully deployed 🚀
https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app

...

𖥔 Deployment complete, new version reachable at https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app
```

</Steps>

The `deploy` command is a one-stop-shop for multiple functionalities needed to
deploy apps on Wasmer Edge. To learn more about the commands available in the
CLI to manage your Wasmer Edge apps, refer to the [dedicated _CLI_
