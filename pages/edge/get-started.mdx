# Get Started with Wasmer Edge

The process to get started with Wasmer Edge is extremely short and intuitive: just install 
the CLI and run a single command. In this page we show this two steps in detail. 

<Steps>
 
<Install />

### Run `wasmer deploy`
This command will make sure that everything is in place for you to deploy your
app: it will guide you through the creation of the app and its deployment.

If you run it in an empty directory, the command will detect that no app is
already available and will prompt you to create a new one, first choosing the
owner of the app..

```shell
$ wasmer deploy                                             
...
Login for Wasmer user <you> saved
It seems you are trying to create a new app!
? Who should own this app? ›
❯ <you> 
```

then the name of the app..

```shell
$ wasmer deploy                                             
...
✔ Who should own this app?  · <you>
? What should be the name of the app? › <your app name> 
````

..and finally the _kind_ of app you want to deploy:
```shell
$ wasmer deploy                                             
...
✔ Who should own this app?  · <you>
✔ What should be the name of the app?  · <your app name> 
? What would you like to deploy? ›
❯ Start with a template
  Choose an existing package
```

To get a grasp of this process, we suggest you to choose to create the app from 
a template:

```shell
$ wasmer deploy                                             
...
✔ Who should own this app? · <you> 
✔ What should be the name of the app? · <your-app-name> 
✔ What would you like to deploy? · Start with a template
✔ Selected template · Static website (demo url https://static-website-sample.wasmer.app/)
✶ Downloading package.. 
```

Once this last step to create an app is finished, the same command will deploy
your first app, without having you execute any other!

```shell
$ wasmer deploy                                             
...
✔ Who should own this app? · <your-app> 
✔ What should be the name of the app? · <your-app-name> 
✔ What would you like to deploy? · Choose an existing package
✔ What is the name of the package? · wasmer/hello
✔ Unpacked template
✔ Do you want to deploy the app now? · yes
