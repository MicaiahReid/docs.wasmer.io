# Get Started with Wasmer Edge

This page will guide you through installing Wasmer, and deploying an already existing package to Wasmer Edge infrastructure.


<Steps>
 
<Install />

<Login />

### Deploy a package

```bash
wasmer deploy edge-examples/hello-world
```

This will create a `deploy.yaml` file with the following contents

```yaml copy filename="deploy.yaml"
kind: wasmer.io/App.v1
meta:
  name: <your-username>/hello-world
spec:
  workload:
    source: edge-examples/hello-world
```

So next time you can simply do `wasmer deploy` when running on a directory with an already existing `deploy.yaml` file.
