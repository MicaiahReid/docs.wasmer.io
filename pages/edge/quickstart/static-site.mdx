# Quickstart for a Static Site

In this quickstart guide, you'll learn the process of publishing a static site.
We will cover installation of the CLI, setting up a new static site, and deploying it.

## Prerequisites

The project requires the following tools to be installed on your system:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Deploying a Static Site

<Steps>

<Install />

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
  Please check that you have the latest version of wasmer runtime as this
  tutorial depends on version **4.1.1** or higher.
</Callout>

<Login />

### Initialize a Static Site

<Callout type="default" emoji="‚öõ">
  If you want to deploy a static site made from frameworks like React, Vue, or
  Svelte, you can follow our [React Static
  Site](/edge/tutorials/react-static-site) tutorial.
</Callout>

With the CLI installed, let's create a new static site!

Run the commands below to create a new directory and initialize:

```bash
$ mkdir my-new-site
$ cd my-new-site
$ wasmer app create --type static-website
Who should own this package?:
> <your-username>
What package do you want to use?:
> Create new package # üëàüèº let's select this for this tutorial
  Use existing package
What should the package be called?: my-new-site
What should be the name of the app?: <your-username>-my-new-site
Would you like to publish the app now? yes
Creating the app...
Publishing package...

[2/2] üì¶  Publishing...
Successfully published package `<your-username>/my-new-site@0.1.0`
Deploying app <your-username>/<your-username>-my-new-site...

 ‚úÖ App <your-username>/<your-username>-my-new-site was successfully deployed!

> App URL: https://<your-username>-my-new-site.wasmer.app
> Versioned URL: https://x43izt2fk0n5.id.wasmer.app # üåê You can access our URL too
> Admin dashboard: https://wasmer.io/apps/<your-username>/<your-username>-my-new-site

(You can safely exit now with CTRL-C)
```

The `wasmer app create --type static-site` command will prompt you for the following:

- **Package owner**: This is the owner of the package. It can be your username or an organization.
- **Package**: This is the package you want to use. You can either select an existing package or create a new one.
- **Package name**: This is the name of your package. It must be unique across all packages on your namespace.
- **App name**: This is the name of your app. It must be unique across all apps on your namespace.
- **Publish**: This will publish the new package and app to the registry.

<Callout type="default" emoji="‚öôÔ∏è">
  As you see above in the last line of the output, the CLI will prompt you to
  publish the new package and app. We recommend publishing the package and app.
</Callout>

The above command will do the following:

- Create a Wasmer package config (`wasmer.toml`)
- Create a app config (`app.yaml`)
- Create a **public** directory that holds the website data

<Callout type="error" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
  Don't change the `public` directory attribute in the `wasmer.toml` file for
  this tutorial. If you want to learn how to specify a different directory for
  build output, check out our [React Static
  Site](/edge/tutorials/react-static-site) tutorial.
</Callout>

Your directory structure should look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="my-new-site" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="index.html" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="app.yaml" />
    <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Add Your Site Content

Currently, the public directory only contains a basic `index.html` file.
The index file should look like this by default in a browser:

<StaticSite image={staticSiteImg} />

You can now modify this directory and copy your own files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc)
as needed.

> For this quickstart, we will use the default `index.html` file.

### Test Your Site Locally

You can also test your site locally before publishing by running the following command:

```shell copy
wasmer run . --net -- --port 9000
```

This will start a local server using the Static Web Server on `http://localhost:9000`.

You can also specify a different port by changing the `--port` flag.

> The arguments after `--` are passed to the static web server.

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  You can see all the available options with `wasmer run --help` or click
  [here](/runtime/cli/) to see the full documentation. To see all the avilable
  options for the static web server, run `wasmer run . -- --help`.
</Callout>

### Deploy Your Site

Once you have added all the necessary files to the public directory, it's time to update site.

Run the following command to deploy your site:

```shell copy
wasmer deploy
```

```shell
Loaded app from: /path/to/your/directory/app.yaml

Publish new version of package '<your-username>/my-new-site'? yes
Publishing package...
[1/2] ‚¨ÜÔ∏è   Uploading...

 ‚úÖ App <your-username>-my-new-site was successfully deployed!

> App URL: https://<your-username>-my-new-site.wasmer.app
> Versioned URL: https://v1piztzfz41v.id.wasmer.app # üåê You can access our URL too
> Admin dashboard: https://wasmer.io/apps/<your-username>/<your-username>-my-new-site

Waiting for the app to become reachable...
(You can safely exit now with CTRL-C)
.
App is now reachable!
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  You must be in the directory holding the `wasmer.toml` and `app.yaml` config
  files.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  `wasmer deploy` automatically publishes your package and bumps the minor
  version. You can check all the available options with `wasmer deploy --help`
  or click [here](/edge/cli) to see the full documentation.
</Callout>

Executing this command will package and deploy your site.

Now you can access your site on the web at the URL provided in the output.

<StaticSite />

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a static site on Wasmer Edge üöÄ.

> Tip: To make changes to your site, simply modify the files in the public directory and run `wasmer deploy` again to deploy the changes.
