# Quickstart for a Static Site

In this quickstart guide, you'll learn the process of publishing a static site using .
We will cover installation of the CLI, setting up a new static site, and deploying it.

## Prerequisites

The project requires the following tools to be installed on your system:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Deploying a Static Site

<Steps>
### Install the Wasmer App CLI

Install the latest version of `Wasmer CLI` following the instructions [here](/install).

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  You can see all commands available with `wasmer --help` or click
  [here](/todo/) to see the full documentation.
</Callout>

### Login

Next, you need to authenticate with Wasmer.

- Create a new account or log in at [Wasmer](https://wasmer.io).
- Navigate to [Wasmer.io Settings](https://wasmer.io/settings) and create a new login token

Now you can log in by running the command below and pasting the token:

```shell copy
$ wasmer login <token>
```

To test that everything works correctly, you can run:

```shell copy
$ wasmer whoami
logged into registry "https://registry.wasmer.io/graphql" as user "<user-name>"
```

### Step 3: Initialize a Static Site

With the CLI installed, let's create a new static site!

Run the commands below to create a new directory and initialize:

```bash
$ mkdir my-new-site
$ cd my-new-site
$ wasmer app create static-site
  Initializing in current directory: (...)/deploy-quickstart/my-new-site
  No wasmer.toml found. Initializing package...
  App name (namespace/name): <your-namespace>/my-new-site
  Public directory (path to the website files): : public
  Creating public directory at '(...)/deploy-quickstart/my-new-site/public'...
  Creating stub index.html...
  Writing wasmer.toml package to '(...)/deploy-quickstart/my-new-site/wasmer.toml'
  No app.yaml found. Configuring new app...
  Writing Deploy config: '(...)/deploy-quickstart/my-new-site/app.yaml'
  Would you like to publish the new package and app? [y/n]: n
  Done!
```

The `wasmer app create static-site` command will prompt you for the following:

- App name: This is the name of your app. It must be unique across all apps on your namespace.
- **Public directory**: This is the directory that holds the website files. The default is `public`.
- **Publish**: This will publish the new package and app to the registry.

<Callout type="default" emoji="‚öôÔ∏è">
  As you see above in the last line of the output, the CLI will prompt you to
  publish the new package and app. We will do this later, so we enter "n" or
  "no".
</Callout>

The above command will do the following:

- Create a Wasmer package config (`wasmer.toml`)
- Create a app config (`app.yaml`)
- Create a public directory that holds the website data

Your directory structure should look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="my-new-site" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="index.html" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="app.yaml" />
    <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Step 4: Add Your Site Content

Currently, the public directory only contains a basic `index.html` file.
The index file should look like this by default in a browser:

<StaticSite />

You can now modify this directory and copy your own files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc)
as needed.

> For this quickstart, we will use the default `index.html` file.

### Step 5: Test Your Site Locally

You can now test your site locally by running the following command:

```shell copy
$ wasmer run . --net -- --port 9000
```

This will start a local server using the Static Web Server on `http://localhost:9000`.

You can also specify a different port by changing the `--port` flag.

> The arguments after `--` are passed to the static web server.

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  You can see all the available options with `wasmer run --help` or click
  [here](/todo/) to see the full documentation. To see all the avilable options
  for the static web server, run `wasmer run . -- --help`.
</Callout>

### Step 6: Deploy Your Site

Once you have added all the necessary files to the public directory, it's time to deploy your site.

Run the following command to deploy your site:

```shell copy
$ wasmer deploy
Publishing package...
[1/2] ‚¨ÜÔ∏è   Uploading...
[2/2] üì¶  Publishing...
Successfully published package `<user-name>/my-new-site@0.1.0`
Package '<user-name>/my-new-site@0.1.0' published successfully!
Writing updates app.yaml...
Publishing app...
App published successfully!
Access your app at: https://x43izt2fqm45.id.wasmer.dev
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  You must be in the directory holding the `wasmer.toml` and `app.yaml` config
  files.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  `wasmer deploy` automatically publishes your package and bumps the minor
  version. You can check all the available options with `wasmer deploy --help`
  or click [here](/edge/cli) to see the full documentation.
</Callout>

Executing this command will package and deploy your site.

Now you can access your site on the web at the URL provided in the output.

<StaticSite />

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a static site using .

To make changes to your site, simply modify the files in the public directory and run `wasmer deploy publish` again to deploy the changes.
