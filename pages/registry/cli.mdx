# The `package` CLI subcommand
Wasmer provides you with CLI commands to work with packages, namely the 
`wasmer package` range of subcommands.

<Callout type="info">
  **Note:** To publish packages to the [registry](https://wasmer.io), users
  need an account. When publishing a package, users are prompted to login if
  they did not already.

## Publishing a package
Once a [package manifest](/registry/manifest) is ready, the user can publish
the package to the registry. In the Wasmer CLI, publishing a package is an easy
operation that involves just one command: `wasmer publish`.

<Callout type="info">
  **Note:** The `wasmer publish` command is a _top level alias_ of 
  `wasmer package publish`: running any of the two commands will result in the execution
  of the same program. 
</Callout>

```shell
$ wasmer package publish
Usage: wasmer package publish [OPTIONS] [path]

Arguments:
  [path]
          Directory containing the `wasmer.toml`, or a custom *.toml manifest file.
          
          Defaults to current working directory.
          
          [default: .]
```

The (non mandatory) argument this command needs is the path to the directory
containing the manifest of the package. By default, the current working is
searched for a `wasmer.toml`. Once a (valid) manifest is found, the package is
built locally and uploaded to the repository. The next conceptual step in this
flow is that of tagging the package, that is, assigning a name and a version to
the package. The command allows users to provide the relevant informations to
tag the package via command flags (`--name`, `--namespace`, `--version`), but
these informations can be synthesized via the manifest or, if the informations
are not given and the program is running interactively, can be provided via
prompts: 

```shell 
$ wasmer package publish 
...
✔ Choose a package name · my-package
✔ Choose a namespace · edoardo
✔ Enter the package version · 0.1.0
...
```

Once the process is completed, the user can refer to the package using the
`namespace/name@version` format.
