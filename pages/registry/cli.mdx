# `wasmer publish` CLI

`wasmer publish` allows publishing a Wasmer container to the [registry](/registry).

## Usage

### Publish a package to Wasmer

Publishing a package to Wasmer is as simple as running the following command:

```bash
wasmer publish
```

This command will create your Wasmer package, and publish it to the Wasmer registry.

  **Note:** You must login to wasmer to use the `publish` command.
</Callout>

#### Dry run

If you want to check that everything is running properly before publishing, you can run `--dry-run`:

```bash
wasmer publish --dry-run
```

<Callout type="default" emoji="💡">
  This will not upload the package to the registry.
</Callout>

## Configuration

You can set the configuration for the registry very easily.

### `registry.url`: Registry URL 

Get:
```
wasmer config get registry.url
```

Set:
```
wasmer config set registry.url https://registry.wasmer.io/graphql
```
