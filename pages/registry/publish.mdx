# Publish a pacakge to Wasmer

Publishing a package to Wasmer is as simple as running the following command:

```bash
wasmer publish
```

This command will create your Wasmer package, and publish it to the Wasmer registry.

## Dry run

If you want to check that everything is running properly before publishing, you can run `--dry-run`:

Note: this will not upload the package to the registry.


```bash
wasmer publish --dry-run
```
