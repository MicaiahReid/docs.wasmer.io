# Get Started with the Wasmer Registry

This page will guide you through installing Wasmer, and publishing a container in the Wasmer Registry.

### Create a package
 
To create your first Wasmer pacakge simply run `wasmer init`.

This should have created a `wasmer.toml` file with contents similar to:

```toml
[package]
name = 'youruser/package'
version = '0.1.0'
description = 'Description for package'

[[module]]
name = 'theprogram'
source = 'target/release/theprogram.wasm'
  
[[command]]
runner = 'wasi'
name = 'theprogram'
module = 'theprogram'
```

You can check the manifest format here: [Wasmer Package Manifest](/registry/manifest).

<Callout type="info">
Once you have a `wasmer.toml` manifest, you can simply execute `wasmer run` in the CLI to run your package locally.

```bash
wasmer run . --command=theprogram
```

</Callout>

### Build your package

Now, create your WebAssembly modules:


<Tabs items={['Rust (WASIX)', 'Rust (WASI)']}>
  <Tab>
    WASI is oficially supported by Rust, to compile to it you can simply do:

    ```bash
    rustup target add wasm32-wasi
    cargo build --target=wasm32-wasi
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash /python\/python/
    cargo install cargo-wasix
    cargo wasix build --release
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Modify the `wasmer.toml` to point the module to the wasm file location `target/release/theprogram.wasm`.

### Publish your package

Now, simply run:

```bash
wasmer publish
```

This command will publish your package to the Wasmer Registry, so it can be used anywhere.
