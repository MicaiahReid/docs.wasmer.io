## Features

All packages published to the Wasmer registry will automatically be available to run with the `wasmer` CLI tool, but not just that...

- **Executables**: The registry will automatically create executables for all platforms and chipsets, with no dependency of Wasmer
- **Automatic documentation**: If you annotate your package with bindings, the documentation and APIs will be automatically generated for all programming languages.
