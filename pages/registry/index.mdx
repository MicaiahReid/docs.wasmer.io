# Wasmer Registry

The Wasmer Registry allows exploring packages from other users and to publish and distribute your own ones.

    WAPM (the WebAssembly Package Manger) has been unified with Wasmer Registry. You can now find all your favorite WAPM packages at <a href="https://wasmer.io">wasmer.io</a>.

## Features

All packages published to the Wasmer regitry will automatically be available to run with the `wasmer` CLI tool, but not just that...
* Executables: the registry will automatically create exectuables for all platforms and chipsets, with no dependency of Wasmer
* Automatic documentation: if you annotate your package with bindings, the documentation and APIs will be automatically generated for all programming languages.
