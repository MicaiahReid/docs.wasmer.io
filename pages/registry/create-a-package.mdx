# Create a Wasmer package

To create your first Wasmer pacakge simply run `wasmer init`.

This should have created a `wasmer.toml` file with contents similar to:

```toml
[package]
name = 'youruser/package'
version = '0.1.0'
description = 'Description for package'

[[module]]
name = 'theprogram'
source = 'target/release/theprogram.wasm'
  
[[command]]
runner = 'wasi'
name = 'theprogram'
module = 'theprogram'
```

Now, create your WebAssembly modules:

```bash
cargo build --target=wasm32-wasi
```

Modify the `wasmer.toml` to point the module to the wasm file location `target/release/theprogram.wasm`.

You can test the command by running this locally:

```
wasmer run . --command=theprogram
```


If everything works locally, now you should be able to publish your package:
